    <textOnly>Dear Mr./Ms. {!Contact.LastName},

Your RIMOWA store in Dubai Mall Galerie Lafayette is now permanently closed.
We will continue to operate from our main store in the Dubai Mall and I will be delighted to welcome and serve you with the same dedication from this other location.
Find below the store address:
Rimowa The Dubai Mall
Fashion Avenue – Ground Floor – Unit GF038
Tel: 045847391

Would you be interested in visiting us at the store?
**It would be great opportunity for me to show you some new products that I think would greatly interest you. **

I thank you for being part of our history in our Dubai Mall Galerie Lafayette store and look forward to assisting you,
