    <textOnly>Dear Mr/Mrs {!Contact.LastName},

I hope you’re enjoying this summery weather,

I wanted to share with you that we received a limited restock of our exclusive DIOR x RIMOWA collaboration.

I especially thought this selection will be great pieces for you.

Extending a courtesy heads-up to make sure you don’t miss on this last opportunity !
