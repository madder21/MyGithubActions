    <subject>New additions to our Never Still collection</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Mr/Mrs {!Contact.LastName},

I wanted to share the newest additions to the Never Still collection with you.

***
Featuring premium quality materials and minimalist design, the new collection of small leather goods includes a phone bag, a cardholder, a passport holder, a mini pouch, and a lanyard keyring.

OR

As you already own a **Owned Product Name**, I though this practical and stylish Italian-made **NS IV Product Name**, would be a perfect addition to your collection.
***

I&#39;d be happy to help if you would like more information.

Best
