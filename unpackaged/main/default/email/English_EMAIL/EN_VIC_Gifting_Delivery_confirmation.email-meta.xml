    <textOnly>Dear Mr./Ms. {!Contact.LastName},

Perfect!

Looking forward to receiving you in-store on **visit date**. I will personally be here to welcome you. / Unfortunately, I will not be at the store on this day, however, my colleague XXX will be happy to assist you.

**book sent**,

I hope you enjoy paging through over a century of RIMOWA history.

Have a lovely day.
