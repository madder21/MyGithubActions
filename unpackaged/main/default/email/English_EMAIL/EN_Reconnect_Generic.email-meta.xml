    <subject>Your personal and local RIMOWA client advisor</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Mr./Ms. {!Contact.LastName},

I would like to introduce myself as your personal local client advisor, on behalf of {!Account.ClientAdvisor__pc} {!Account.MainStore__pc}.

Your RIMOWA **MODEL** has now been a companion for awhile now and we hope it has been trustworthy throughout your travels. 

As a token of our appreciation for your loyalty and to help prepare for your future journeys,  I would love to welcome you to our {!Account.Local_Main_Store__c} for a complimentary **check-up of your suitcase / hot-stamping of your luggage tag **. 

Should you be interested, I would be happy to organise your visit in-store.  

Kind regards,


{!User.Name}
