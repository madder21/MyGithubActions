    <textOnly>Dear Mr./Mrs. {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you for letting us know you cannot attend the Mother’s Day event.

During the event, we will showcase three new designs that are joining our Never Still bag collection: the Messenger Bag, the Briefcase, and the Flat Pouch.

The collection launches on May 6th. However, I would like to invite you to an exclusive preview with 1-on-1 appointments from Apr 24th to May 5th. If you need more details, or would like to book your appointment, I would be happy to assist.

Look forward to hearing from you!

Kind regards,
