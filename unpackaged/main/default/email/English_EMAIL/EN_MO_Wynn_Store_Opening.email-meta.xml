    <textOnly>Dear Mr/Mrs {!Contact.LastName},

I hope you are doing well!

I am pleased to let you know that we have a new RIMOWA store in Wynn Palace. To celebrate its opening,  the latest Never Still bag designs will be exclusively available there from July 30 - August 11. In addition, you can enjoy a two-day early access to the limited-edition Essential Neon suitcases, which will be available at the Wynn store from Jul 30 – 31 before their official launch.

## I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that I will be working at RIMOWA Wynn Palace from now on. Thank you for shopping with me in XXX Store, and I would be happy to connect you with my colleagues at XXX store should you need anything more. If you are interested in the new collection, I would be delighted to assist you with a product reservation or an appointment at RIMOWA Wynn Palace. You&#39;ll find its address below:
