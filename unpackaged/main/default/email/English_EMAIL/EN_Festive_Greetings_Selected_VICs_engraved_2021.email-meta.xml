    <textOnly>Dear Mr/Mrs {!Contact.LastName},

I hope you are doing well ***PERSONALISED PART – HOLIDAY GREETING / FAMILY CHECK***

To celebrate this new chapter, we would like to gift a special luggage tag. This luggage will be personalised with your name to continue traveling in style. I&#39;d love to gift it to you in person should you be available to visit us in [STORE]. **Which nickname would you like to see engraved?**

On behalf of all of us at RIMOWA, I&#39;d like to personally thank you for your continued loyalty and support – it’s always a pleasure assisting you.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
