    <subject>Your personal and local RIMOWA client advisor</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Mr, Mrs {!Contact.LastName},

Your RIMOWA has now been a companion for awhile now and we hope it has been trustworthy throughout your travels.

On behalf of the RIMOWA team, I would like to introduce myself as your personal client advisor. I will be happy to assist you in any way and remain at your disposal. 

To prepare your future journeys, I would love to welcome you in {!Account.Local_Main_Store__c} to offer a complimentary **check-up of your suitcase / hot-stamping of your luggage tag **. 

Should you be interested, I would be happy to organise your visit in-store.  

Kind regards,
