Dear Mr/Mrs {!Contact.LastName},

We are excited to announce the relaunch of one of RIMOWA’s most iconic designs: the aluminum Attaché Silver.
 
A staple of the company since 1960s, the legendary RIMOWA Attaché has been revisited for a new generation of business travellers and more. 
Crafted in Köln, the RIMOWA Attaché pairs a vintage sensibility with minimalist design and offers a luxurious interior adapted to today’s needs!

I'd be happy to share more about the launch with you if you are interested in.

Kind regards,
